### INTRODUCTION<br>

<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align:justify;">The major inputs of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) to natural water are from atmosphere and photosynthetic reaction. Where the algae and phytoplankton production is high, the saturation of oxygen can occur during daytime. The solubility of oxygen in water depends on temperature and other factors. The presence of oxygen is essential for the survival of aquatic life in water. A rapid fall of DO in river water is one of the first indications of pollution.</p>

#### Significance :

<li style="text-align:justify;">It is necessary to know the DO level to assess quality of raw water and to keep a check on stream pollution.</li>

<li style="text-align:justify;">A minimum DO of 4 to 5 mg/l is desirable for the survival of aquatic life.</li>

<li style="text-align:justify;">Higher values of DO may cause corrosion of Iron and steel.</li>

<li style="text-align:justify;">DO test is used to evaluate the pollution strength of domestic and industrial wastes.</li>

#### Winkler’s Modified Method :
<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align:justify;">The Winkler’s Method is the technique used to measure DO in freshwater structures. It is used as an indicator of the health of a water body, where higher DO concentrations are associated with high production and little contamination. This test is performed on-site, as delays between sample collections and testing may result in a variation in oxygen content.</p>
<p style="text-indent:50px; text-align:justify;">In this method of analysis the oxygen present in the water sample oxidizes the divalent manganous ion to its higher valency, which precipitates as a brown hydrated oxide after addition of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and potassium iodide (KI). Upon acidification, manganese reverts to divalent state and liberates iodine from KI equivalent to DO content in the sample. The liberated iodine is titrated against sodium thiosulphate (0.025N), using freshly prepared 2% starch solution as indicator. If the oxygen is absent in the sample, the MnSO<sub>4</sub> react with the alkali to form white precipitate Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>.</p>
