#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :   <u> Expository </u>
###### Assessment Method: <u> Summative Assessment</u>

<u> <b>Description:</b> </u> <u> Instructional Strategy will be implemented in the simulator as follows: </u>
<br>
Detailed theory is provided by considering all the aspects which develops intuition and deeper understanding of concepts, also reference will be provided for further information. In order to understand the process followed in simulation a complete set of procedure will be provided which helps the students to perform simulation. Step by step procedure which is carried out in lab manually is being simulated which gives exposure to real laboratory apparatus, empowering independent learning. Pre-quiz and post-quiz will be provided to test the understanding of the students before and after performing the experiments. Assignment questions will be provided to the students to make them explore more on the experiments. Once the students go through the virtual lab experiments, they can perform those experiments in real lab effectively.

3.| Student will be able to calculate the values of DO for the given sample | Click on the button to see the formula used to calculate the results and then obtain the required value and check the result | Q1) What has to be done if  sample water does not contain enough microorganism? <br>A. <u>Seeding the sample</u> <br> B. Boiling the sample <br> C. Treating it with alkaline solution <br>D. All of the above <br><br> Q2) What happens if DO of given sample is very less in river water? <br>A. No Influence <br>B. <u>Flora and Fauna cannot survive</u> <br>C. Both a and b <br>D. None of the above |
4.| Student will be able to infer the significance of Dissolved Oxygen in sample | Infer the significance of the Dissolved Oxygen from the obtained result with the help of table containing different Dissolved Oxygen range with their significance | Q1) High amount of Dissolved Oxygen in a lake indicate <br>A. <u>Poor water quality</u> <br>B. High turbidity <br>C. Good water quality <br>D. Excessive aquatic plant or algae blooms |
